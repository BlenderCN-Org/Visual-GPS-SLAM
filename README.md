## Dependencies
### Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO)
This work uses the Direct Sparse Odometry Project by TUM (see: https://vision.in.tum.de/dso and https://github.com/JakobEngel/dso). License: GPL-v3.

### Direct Sparse Odometry for ROS (ros-dso)
There is also a ros-wrapper for DSO, which is used for the real-time part of this work (see https://github.com/JakobEngel/dso_ros). The "catkin" branch by Nikolaus Demmel was actually used here, as the original "rosmake" version did not work for me. License: GPL-v3.
